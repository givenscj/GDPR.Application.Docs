# Application Messages

All applications have users and every user has a contact preference.  When you want to contact your users you can create an application message and send each of your users that message via their notication channel and in their preferred lanauage.

## Creating messages

You can create application messages by browsing to the application in the tenant portal and then selecting **Application Messages**

## Translating messages

You can create messages using your native language and then have it translated to target your user preferences.

Translation is done via Azure or other cloud platform translation and may or may not be perfect in its translation. Translation services are provided as a "use at your own risk" service.

You should always have someone review the translation of a message to ensure it says what you want it to say.

## Estimating Message Costs

Sending message to users can have a cost associated.  There are several ways in which a user may want to be contacts including:

-   Email
-   Phone
-   Letter
-   Facebook
-   Twitter

### Emails

Emails are simply to and easy to send, and cost nothing.  However services that verify that a message has been received and has not bounced back, do cost extra.
