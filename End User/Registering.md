#   Registering with the System

There are several ways to register with the Privacy Platform.  In most cases, you will likely use an external 3rd party to do so.  

##   Supported 3rd Party Login

3rd party authentication is enabled by the system administrator.  They have the ability to enable any of the following:

-   Facebook
-   Microsoft (Microsoft Account, Azure AD or LinkedIn)
-   Amazon
-   Google

##  Local Logins

Additionally, to support individuals that may not have a supported 3rd party authentication, you can also create a local user account.  This will record your emailaddress and then utilize the strongest hashing mechanisms available today to hash your password.  The selected hash algorithms utilize high workload factors that would require hackers to have access to massive supercomputers for several years.  It means the platform may be a bit slower than what you are used too, but your security is of utmost importance!

##  IVR/Phone Login

If you do not have an email address, you can also authenticate to the system using your mobile phone.  You can find the phone number to call on the privacy platfomr login/registration pages.
