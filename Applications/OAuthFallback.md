# OAuth Fallback

Some applications support the ability to fallback to a system level Client ID and Secret if the tenant's application is lacking it.  When the application is created and the setting is enabled, the system client id and secret will be used.  Not all applications support this however due to the back end APIs implementations.

## Supported Applications

-   Azure AD
-   Constant Contact
-   Dynamics
-   Salesforce
-   Yammer
