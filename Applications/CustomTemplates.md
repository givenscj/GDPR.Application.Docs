# Custom Templates

Using the Privacy Platform SDK, you can build your own appliaction stubs which can then be uploaded into the system.  For the core Privacy Central platform, all applicaiton templates must go through a review process before we will allow them to be utilized.

When hosting on your own instance, you are free to upload new templates into the system and then create application based on them.

Follow these steps to create your own template:

-   Create a new application using the Privacy Platform SDK
-   Upload the template dll through the admin portal
